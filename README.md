# Hello-world
The beginning of all!!

As excited as I am to start typing onto my first Github file, I'm scared shitless. I really hope for this to inspire me and keep me learning about coding and softwares, of which I hardly know anything. It's a strangely different feeling to do something you've never done before for the first time. I just hope this will be the first of many to come!

Cheers! 

PS. As you've guessed I'm a person of many words :P
